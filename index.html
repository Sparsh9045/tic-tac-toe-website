        Rules for the game
      </h3>
      <li> The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.</li>

      <li>You are X and the computer in this case is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.</li>

      <li> The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.</li>

      <li> When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.</li>
